This SQL assignment demonstrates the creation of two relational tables—Employees and Projects—followed by the implementation of various time functions and analytic (window) functions. The Employees table stores details such as employee ID, name, department, salary, and joining date, while the Projects table records project information including project ID, employee ID, project name, start time, and end time. Using these tables, a single consolidated query is used to apply multiple time functions, including CURRENT_DATE(), NOW(), DATE(), TIME(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY(), DATE_ADD(), DATE_SUB(), and DATEDIFF(), along with setting the timezone using SET time_zone. These functions help extract and manipulate date and time values. Additionally, the assignment uses several analytic SQL functions such as ROW_NUMBER() to sequence projects per employee, RANK() and DENSE_RANK() to rank employees based on salary, PARTITION BY to rank employees within their departments, FIRST_VALUE() to identify the first project handled by each employee, and PERCENT_RANK() to calculate the salary percentile. Overall, this assignment showcases SQL capabilities in data handling, time-based operations, and advanced analytical processing using window functions.
